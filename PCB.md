# PCB Design process Rules
### Following the correct board design rules often limits unnecessary delays and PCB maintenance and ensures a high-speed PCB. While concentrating on the circuit design and component selection is crucial, ignoring the rules can cost your project digitally and physically. 

### So, what are some of the rules during a design for manufacturability? 

# PCB Design Rules for Analog Circuits
### The layout process comprises; 

### Ensuring a clear return path of the analog signal and filling the pathways with short and direct traces of components. Obstructed pathways cause unnecessary noise since the returning analog signal strolls near a ground plane when locating the direct and shortest path to the origin. 
### Secondly, employ an analog ground plane to separate it from a digital plane, thereby avoiding interference. 
### Thirdly, maintain direct and short signal layers. It prevents electromagnetic interference in PCB elements because of impedance discrepancy causing reflections at higher frequencies. 
### Then, separate sections on Analog and Digital Circuity to minimize noise. Also, do not route divisions of analog circuitry to high-speed digital components as it’ll prevent the noise influence. 
### Finally, place your analog component tightly to achieve a simplified direct routing and separate digital and analog circuitry. 
### SMD PCB Design Rule check
### Usually, maintaining a good spacing between electronic components and a few trace numbers makes it simpler to sprint the surface route. 
# Step-by-Step PCB Design Guide

### As a PCB designer, use the method of assembly in the guideline to attain a quality design goal for your PCB board. 

### Always comprehend the electrical parameters of your board layout system, e.g., capacitance limitations, integrated circuits, voltages, etc. 
## Secondly, create a schematic diagram whereby you’ll design the PCB at the electrical level of its function/purpose. 
### Next, create a PCB layout with the schematic capture software tool like Altium designer. It’ll display where to place the components and the board’s operation in an intended device. 
### Afterward, design your PCB stack up as it’ll determine the impedance (how fast/much electricity travels down a PCB trace).  
### Fifthly, define the requirements and design rules through the acceptability criteria and standards from IPC. Furthermore, you can find a circuit board provider with knowledge of the standard rules to limit project delays and constant revisions. 
### Now, gently place the components using a datasheet on each of them using molted solder. Then, you can proceed with the placement via a mechanical layout and PCB design.
