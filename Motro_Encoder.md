# We need
## 1.Motor with encoder

## 2.Arduino board ( I used arduino Uno)

## 3.Computer

## 4.Battery or DC voltage supply

## 5.Encoder library , download from https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html or from the zip file attached

## 6.Background : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder

## 7.( A little experiment I did with multimeter :

### power the encoder with 2 AA battery, attach multimeter GND cable to GND of the battery , and multimeter RED cable to the C1 or C2 output of the encoder.

### As you turn the motor slowly, you can see that the output voltage of C1 and C2 change from 0V to 3V.
### If you have 2 multimeter, attach C1 and C2 each to a multimeter, then turn the multimeter slowly you can see the value of multimeter change from 3V-3V, 0V-3V,0V-0V,3V-3V, which is the pulse according the background theory)
